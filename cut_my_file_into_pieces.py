"""
Script for cutting wav.-files into 3 second long pieces.
Each piece is saved as its own wav.-file.

Original files which are to be cut must be stored inside a specific structure of folders.
It uses a main folder named 'Dataset_new' with the three subfolders 'Speech', 'Noise' and 'Music'.
The cut pieces are stored in folders of the same structure. 
Here the main folder is named 'Dataset_new_cut', while the three subfolders remain the same.
In order to use this script the main folders must be created in the same directory as this script.
